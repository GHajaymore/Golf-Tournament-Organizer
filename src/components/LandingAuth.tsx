/**
 * The real sign-in form, embedded in the landing page so every "Sign in" and
 * "Start free" call-to-action has somewhere on the page to land.
 *
 * The CTAs are plain anchors to #signin / #signup (which resolve to the anchor
 * spans just above this in the auth section, so they scroll correctly even
 * before hydration). This watches the hash so "Start free" opens the panel in
 * its sign-up state, while "Sign in" opens it logged-in — the panel keeps its
 * own two-tab control either way, so a visitor can still switch.
 *
 * `key={mode}` remounts LoginPanel when the intent changes, which is what makes
 * `initialMode` take effect on a second click without LoginPanel needing to
 * reconcile a prop against internal tab state.
